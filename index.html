	  <p>My name is Jordan Kauffman. Currently, I am a commuting student to IIT, since I am also currently working. I work for a company called Bastion Distribution, which is run out of a warehouse in Elkhart, IN. Currently, 
		I mostly handle the customer service, but I occasionally help with the warehouse-related tasks. This is the start of my third year at IIT, and I am very excited to be furthering my web-development knowledge with you
		all. <strong>Experience</strong> As for this class, the only real experience I have with development at the moment comes from brief experiences in highschool, and a majority from Professor Kreiglstein's classes.</p>

	<h2>Stuff I Like</h2>
	  <img src="images/CowboyBebop.png" alt="Cowboy_Bebop_Poster">
	  <p>I am a huge nerd about most typical stuff, like video games, movies, and anime. I can most likely be seen playing a few games, such as Darkest Dungeon, Black Ops 3, Balatro (which I am a big fan of as of its release),
	    and a few other scattered games in there (such as, regrettably, <abbr>League of Legends</abbr>). For movies, my personal favorite series will probably always be the Ocean's series (11, 12, and 13. I did not bother with 8). However,
		a lot of recent releases have held my attention as of late, especially films like 1917 and <abbr>Oppenheimer</abbr>. Lastly, all I will say about anime for now, so as not to make myself seem like a ginormous loser, is that "Cowboy
		Bebop" will always be my favorite show I have ever watched. Plain and simple, Cowboy Bebop is a genuine <strong>10/10</strong>, and I will not change my stance on that.</p>

    <h2>Closing (for now)</h2>
	  <p>That is about all there is to need to know about me. If you have any other questions, go ahead and shoot me an email if you feel like. I may or may not answer. Who knows. Anyways, again, looking forward to working
	    with you all, and can't wait to see where we go. Thanks for reading about me!</p>
